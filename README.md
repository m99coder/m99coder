### My Latest Article

I’ve been diving deeper into the WebAssembly Component Model lately, and I finally sat down to write up a hands-on example in Rust.

The article walks through the creation of a tiny “decider” app, split into two components: one library that implements a simple interface, and one command component that calls it. The fun part is plugging them together and running the whole thing as a composed Wasm component with Wasmtime.

It’s a small example, but for me it really clarified how the component model makes composition and reuse feel natural — much closer to building with Lego bricks than with raw Wasm modules.

If you’re curious about WebAssembly beyond the basics, this might be a good place to start:<br />
