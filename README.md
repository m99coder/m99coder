### My Latest Article

<a href="https://m99.io/articles/create-and-compose-webassembly-components-a-hands-on-example-with-rust" target="_blank"><img src="https://m99.io/articles/create-and-compose-webassembly-components-a-hands-on-example-with-rust/index.png" alt="Create and Compose WebAssembly Components: A Hands-On Example with Rust" width="400" /></a>

I‚Äôve been diving deeper into the WebAssembly Component Model lately, and I finally sat down to write up a hands-on example in Rust.

The article walks through the creation of a tiny ‚Äúdecider‚Äù app, split into two components: one library that implements a simple interface, and one command component that calls it. The fun part is plugging them together and running the whole thing as a composed Wasm component with Wasmtime.

It‚Äôs a small example, but for me it really clarified how the component model makes composition and reuse feel natural ‚Äî much closer to building with Lego bricks than with raw Wasm modules.

If you‚Äôre curious about WebAssembly beyond the basics, this might be a good place to start:<br />
